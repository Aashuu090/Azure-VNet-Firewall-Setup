# 🌐 Azure Virtual Network with Firewall, Bastion & NGINX

This project demonstrates how I built a secure **Virtual Network (VNet)** in **Microsoft Azure** using key networking components.

---

## 🧩 Project Overview
The goal was to create a secure, segmented Azure environment that includes:
- **Virtual Network (VNet)** for logical isolation  
- **Azure Firewall** for centralized traffic filtering  
- **Azure Bastion** for secure VM access via browser  
- **Web Subnet with Ubuntu VM** running **NGINX**

## ⚙️ Steps I Followed
1. Created a **VNet** with subnets: Firewall, Bastion, and Web  
2. Deployed **Azure Firewall** to control inbound/outbound traffic  
3. Configured **Network Security Groups (NSG)**  
4. Created an **Ubuntu VM** and installed **NGINX**  
5. Accessed the web server securely using **Azure Bastion**
